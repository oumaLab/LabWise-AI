Medical Reference Context for LabWise AI (CBC Analysis)

[HEMOGLOBIN]
Hemoglobin (Hb) is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.
- Normal Range (Men): 13.5 to 17.5 g/dL
- Normal Range (Women): 12.0 to 15.5 g/dL
- Low Level (Anemia): Causes fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath.
- High Level (Polycythemia): Can be caused by dehydration, smoking, or living at high altitudes.
- Interpretation: Low hemoglobin indicates anemia, which requires finding the cause (iron deficiency, vitamin deficiency, or other).

[WBC - White Blood Cells]
White Blood Cells (Leukocytes) are part of the immune system.
- Normal Range: 4,500 to 11,000 cells/mcL
- High Level (Leukocytosis): Usually indicates an infection (bacterial/viral), inflammation, stress, or sometimes leukemia.
- Low Level (Leukopenia): Can be caused by autoimmune issues, bone marrow problems, or severe infections.
- Interpretation: High WBC often signals the body is fighting something. Low WBC means the immune system is lowered.

[PLATELETS]
Platelets (Thrombocytes) help blood clot to stop bleeding.
- Normal Range: 150,000 to 450,000 /mcL
- Low Level (Thrombocytopenia): Risk of bleeding, bruising. Causes include viral infections (dengue), medications, or autoimmune diseases.
- High Level (Thrombocytosis): Can be reactive (infection, inflammation) or essential (bone marrow disorder).
- Interpretation: Abnormal platelets affect clotting. Very low levels are a medical emergency.

[GENERAL ADVICE]
- Always Consult a Doctor: Lab results must be interpreted in the context of symptoms and history.
- Prevention: Balanced diet (Iron, B12 for Hb), hygiene (for infection prevention), and regular checkups.
